# About Me

## Academic Background

I graduated with a degree in Mathematics in October 2022. My thesis, titled **[La teoria di Payley Littlewood e alcune sue applicazioni in analisi](https://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-10012022-110009/)**, focused on Harmonic Analysis and resulted in a published article in the **Bollettino Unione Matematica Italiana**. In the article, **"A Note on the Fractional Hardy Inequality"**, my thesis supervisor and I present a minor enhancement of Hardy's inequality. Since graduation, I have developed an interest in machine learning, completing online courses including Andrew Ngâ€™s **Machine Learning Specialization**.

## Current Studies

In 2023, I began the **Master in Mathematical and Physical Methods** program, where I am expanding my expertise in mathematical modeling techniques.

## Professional Experience

During the MPM Master, I undertook a curricular internship at **Leonardo Divisione Velivoli**, Corso Francia, 426, 10146 Torino, where I worked on **computer vision** and **3D deep learning**. This role provided me with hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies and allowed me to apply my mathematical knowledge to practical problems.
