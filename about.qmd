## Academic Background

I graduated in October 2022 with a degree in Mathematics. My thesis, titled **"Note on the Hardy Inequality"**, focused on Harmonic Analysis and led to a published article in the **Bollettino Unione Matematica Italiana**. In this article, I presented a slight improvement of Hardy's inequality.

## Current Studies

In 2023, I enrolled in the **Master in Mathematical and Physical Methods**, where I am deepening my knowledge in mathematical modeling and advanced physical methods.

## Professional Experience

I completed an internship at **Leonardo**, focusing on **computer vision** and **3D deep learning**. This experience allowed me to work on cutting-edge technologies and apply my mathematical skills to real-world problems.

## Selected Publications and Projects

- **Article**: "A Slight Improvement of Hardy's Inequality" published in Bollettino Unione Matematica Italiana (2023).
- **Thesis**: "Note on the Hardy Inequality".
- **Internship**: Leonardo, focusing on computer vision and 3D deep learning.
