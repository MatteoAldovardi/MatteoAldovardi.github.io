Here are some of the key projects and publications Iâ€™ve worked on:

- **Project 1**: Internship with Leonardo in 3D Deep Learning  
  As part of the [Master's in Mathematical and Physical Models for Engineering](https://www.dipmatematica.unito.it/do/home.pl/View?doc=/master/Master_MPM_Space_Sciences.html&sb=0#:~:text=The%20Master%20in%20Mathematical%20and%20physical), I completed a curricular internship at Leonardo Divisione Velivoli, in Turin. During this time, I worked on computer vision and 3D deep learning projects, gaining hands-on experience with advanced technologies and leveraging my mathematical expertise to tackle practical challenges in real-world applications.

- **Publication**: [A Note on Hardy's Inequality for Pseudo-Differential Operators](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40574-023-00359-7)  
  This publication explores applications of Hardy's inequality within the realm of pseudo-differential operators, contributing insights into mathematical analysis and operator theory.
