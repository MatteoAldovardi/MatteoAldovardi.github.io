## Introduction

Integrals are a fundamental concept in calculus. In this document, we'll explore various types of basic integrals, their properties, and examples.

## 1. **Indefinite Integrals**

An indefinite integral represents a family of functions that have the same derivative. It is denoted as:

$$
\int f(x)\,dx
$$

### 1.1 Power Rule

The integral of \( x^n \), where \( n \neq -1 \), is given by:

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
$$

#### Example:
$$
\int x^3 \, dx = \frac{x^4}{4} + C
$$

### 1.2 Exponential Functions

The integral of an exponential function with base \( e \) is:

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

#### Example:
$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

### 1.3 Trigonometric Functions

- **Sine function**:
$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
$$

- **Cosine function**:
$$
\int \cos(x) \, dx = \sin(x) + C
$$

#### Example:
$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
$$

## 2. **Definite Integrals**

A definite integral represents the area under a curve between two bounds. It is expressed as:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx
$$

### 2.1 Example of Definite Integral

To compute the area under the curve \( y = x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \):

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
$$

This represents the area under the curve from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \).

## 3. **Integration by Substitution**

When faced with complex integrals, we often use substitution to simplify the process. The substitution rule states:

$$
\int f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du
$$

### 3.1 Example of Substitution

Let's solve the following integral using substitution:

$$
\int 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx
$$

Let \( u = x^2 \), then \( du = 2x \, dx \). The integral becomes:

$$
\int \cos(u) \, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(x^2) + C
$$

Thus, the result is:

$$
\int 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx = \sin(x^2) + C
$$

## 4. **Integration by Parts**

The integration by parts formula is derived from the product rule for derivatives. It is given by:

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

### 4.1 Example of Integration by Parts

To solve the integral \( \int x e^x \, dx \), we let:

- \( u = x \) (so \( du = dx \))
- \( dv = e^x \, dx \) (so \( v = e^x \))

Using the integration by parts formula:

$$
\int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C
$$

Thus:

$$
\int x e^x \, dx = e^x(x - 1) + C
$$

## Conclusion

In this document, we covered a variety of basic integrals, including indefinite and definite integrals, and methods such as substitution and integration by parts. These techniques are fundamental for solving a wide range of problems in calculus and beyond.
